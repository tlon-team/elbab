@node 0 New job
@section 0. New job

This is a phase prior to the actual process, and that is why we call it ``phase 0''. It consists of (a) creating an entry in Ebib of the job to be translated and then (b) running, with the cursor on that entry, the @code{tlon-create-job} command. @*

This command does three things: @*

@enumerate
@item
It imports the content of the job in Markdown format and saves it as a file in a directory specified by the user (by default, the @code{articles} folder). @*
@item
It creates a file in the appropriate translations repository, with the relevant metadata. @*
@item
It creates a ``record'' associated with this work, consisting of (a) a @emph{issue} on GitHub and (b) a @emph{heading} on @code{jobs.org}. @*
@itemize
@item
While the @emph{issue} on GitHub is used to discuss translation-related issues and coordinate the different phases of the process, the @emph{heading} allows us to prioritize the different jobs and leave non-translation-related comments, such as author permissions issues. @*
@end itemize
@end enumerate

In special cases, one or two of these three steps may need to be omitted. For example, there may already be an entry for the translation of the work, or we may already have the document in Markdown format and do not need to import it. In these cases, @code{tlon-create-job} should not be run and instead the commands corresponding to the relevant steps should be run manually: @*

@enumerate
@item
To import a document: @code{tlon-import-document}. @*
@item
To create the translation file : @code{tlon-create-translation-file}. @*
@item
To create a record: @code{tlon-create-record-for-job}. @*
@end enumerate

If the commands fail to import a URL, this may be due to a @emph{bug} or a problem with Pandoc. To determine what happened, examine the message buffer. For example, if we see that the buffer says @code{pandoc: Cannot decode byte '\xf9': Data.Text.Internal.Encoding: Invalid UTF-8 stream}, this tells us that the problem is with Pandoc. In such a case, you can import the file manually using the @uref{https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi, MarkDownload} extension. @*

If the problem is not with Pandoc, alert Pablo to fix the @emph{bug}. @*

@node GitHub and org-mode synchronization
@chapter GitHub and org-mode synchronization

@code{tlon} includes several functions to synchronize the GitHub issues on a given repository with the corresponding @code{org-mode} TODOs in the user’s local file. The relevant GitHub sync functions are accessed from @code{tlon-dispatch} (@code{H-r}), under the “sync” section (@code{y}): @*

@itemize
@item
``visit or capture'' (@code{tlon-visit-counterpart-or-capture}, @code{H-r y y}): visits the “counterpart” (the associated @code{org-mode} TODO if point is on a GitHub issue, and vice versa) or, if point is on an issue that has not yet been captured, creates an associated @code{org-mode} TODO@. This command can also be invoked directly by pressing @code{,} with point on an issue or visiting an issue buffer. It may be regarded as a “dwim” (“do-what-I-mean”) command, in the sense that it is meant to guess the action that the user will normally want to perform in the relevant context. @*
@item
``visit'' (@code{tlon-visit-counterpart}, @code{H-r y v}): visits the “counterpart”. If point is on an issue that has not yet been captured, no action will be taken. @*
@item
``post'' (@code{tlon-create-issue-from-todo}, @code{H-r y p}): posts the @code{org-mode} TODO at point to GitHub, i.e. creates an associated GitHub issue. @*
@item
``capture'' (@code{tlon-capture-issue}, @code{H-r y c}): captures the GitHub issue at point, i.e. creates an associated @code{org-mode} TODO@. @*
@item
``capture all'' (@code{tlon-capture-all-issues}, @code{H-r y C}): like the above, but iterates over all GitHub issues in the repository. @*
@item
``reconcile'' (@code{tlon-reconcile-issue-and-todo} , @code{H-r y r}): reconcile any differences between a GitHub issue and its associated @code{org-mode} TODO@. If differences are found, the user will be prompted to indicate whether they want to keep the GitHub issue and modify the @code{org-mode} TODO to match it (@code{i}), or vice versa (@code{t}). (Note: usually you want to keep the issue, so you will normally press @code{i} when prompted). @*
@item
``reconcile all'' (@code{tlon-reconcile-all-issues-and-todos}, @code{H-r y R}): like the above, but iterates over all GitHub issues in the repository. Note that issues not yet captured will be ignored, so you may want to  capture all issues (@code{tlon-capture-all-issues}) before reconciling them, if your goal is to ensure that the your @code{org-mode} TODOs are fully in sync with the GitHub issues. @*
@item
``close'' (@code{tlon-close-issue-and-todo}, @code{H-r y x}): close the GitHub issue and mark its associated @code{org-mode} TODO as DONE@. @*
@end itemize

@node Editing Markdown
@chapter Editing Markdown

This section describes the custom commands we use to edit Markdown files. @*

All the relevant commands can be called from @code{tlon-md-menu}, the Markdown menu, bound to @code{s-d} (“d” as in “dispatcher”). @*

[We extend the native Markdown markup language with various custom @uref{https://mdxjs.com/, MDX} tags.] @*

[Point out that the user should insert the relevant entities using the Emacs commands whenever possible, to avoid human error.] @*

@node Commands to insert mathematical expressions
@section Commands to insert mathematical expressions

Our websites support @LaTeX{}-formatted math. These expressions may be of two types: @emph{inline} and @emph{display}. Inline expressions are embedded in a paragraph, while display expressions occupy their own paragraph. @*

Inline expressions are delimited by @code{$`} and @code{`$}, like this: @*

@example
[T]he marginal chance of success is proportional to $`1/x`$, where $`x`$ is the total amount of resources that will be devoted to the problem before the point where we need a solution.
@end example

Display expressions, in turn, are delimited by double dollar signs, like this: @*

@example
$$
\frac@{v(S)@}@{v(L)@}\ =\ \frac@{p(S)@}@{p(L)@}\ \times\ \frac@{n(S)@}@{n(L)@}\ \times\ \frac@{r(L)@}@{r(S)@}
$$
@end example

Note that the dollar sign delimiters occupy their own lines. @*

Inline and display expressions can be inserted with @code{tlon-md-insert-math-inline} and with @code{tlon-md-insert-math-display}, respectively. If called in an active region, the selected text will be enclosed by the appropriate delimiters. Otherwise, the delimiters will be inserted at point. These commands can also be inserted from @code{tlon-md-menu} (@code{H-;}). @*

@node Commands to insert citations
@section Commands to insert citations

To insert citations, we use the custom MDX tag @code{Cite}. This self-closing tag takes the mandatory attribute @code{bibKey} and the optional attribute @code{short}. The value type of @code{bibKey} is a single Bib@TeX{} key, optionally followed by one or more @uref{https://docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/specification.html#locators, locators}. The attribute @code{short} indicates that the citation is a “short” citation. @*

“Short” citations are defined as citations that only display the title of the work, rather than its full bibliographic details. Such citations are appropriate in contexts in which the work is being referred to explicitly rather than merely cited, as in this example: @*

@example
As Toby Ord writes in <Cite bibKey=@{"Ord2020PrecipiceExistentialRisk"@} short />, humanity’s long-term potential may be lost this century.
@end example

which is rendered as @*

@example
As Toby Ord writes in *The Precipice*, humanity’s long-term potential may be lost this century.
@end example

To insert a normal citation, use @code{tlon-mdx-insert-cite}. To insert a short citation, use @code{tlon-mdx-insert-cite-short}. To insert a locator, invoke @code{tlon-insert-locator} with point on a citation. These three commands may also be called from @code{tlon-md-menu} (@code{H-;}), with the keys @code{c}, @code{C} and @code{l}, respectively. @*

@node Commands to insert note markers
@section Commands to insert note markers

A note may be of two types: a @emph{footnote}, shown at the end of the web page, and a @emph{sidenote}, shown on the side of the page. We indicate that a note is a footnote or a sidenote with the self-enclosing tags @code{<Footnote />} and @code{<Sidenote />}, respectively. These tags may, and should, be inserted with the corresponding commands, @code{tlon-insert-footnote-marker} and @code{tlon-insert-sidenote-marker}, bound to the letters @code{f} and @code{s} in the Markdown transient menu. @*

We use a system of automatic classification of notes into either footnotes or sidenotes that seeks to capture the intuitive idea that some notes are merely bibliographic while others are substantive. Currently, the criterion classifies a note as a footnote if it contains at least one citation and four words or less, excluding citations. To auto-classify the note at point, call @code{tlon-auto-classify-note-at-point} (@code{n}). To auto-classify all notes in the file, call @code{tlon-auto-classify-notes-in-file} (@code{N}). @*

Note that, while the two commands in the first paragraph of this section will replace an existing note tag, if present (e.g. a @code{<Sidenote />} tag in a note will be replaced by a @code{<Footnote />} tag if @code{tlon-insert-footnote-marker} is invoked with point on it), the two commands in the second paragraph will instead keep the existing tags. This behavior is intended to reflect the fact that a manual classification should take precedence over an automatic classification. @*

@node Other commands
@section Other commands

@code{tlon-edit-yaml-field} @*

@code{tlon-insert-internal-link} @*


Special characters—such as em and en dashes, thin and non-breaking spaces, ellipsis and dots, and most other characters we may want to insert not accessible in a normal keyboard—can be inserted with @code{tlon-insert-special-character}. The user option @code{tlon-md-special-characters} customizes the list of characters offered as completion candidates. @*
